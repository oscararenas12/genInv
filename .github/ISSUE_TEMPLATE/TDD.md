## Task Title
[Provide a clear and concise title for the TDD task.]

---

### Description
[Provide a brief description of the feature or functionality you’re implementing using TDD.]

### Acceptance Criteria
Define the criteria that the solution must meet to be considered complete. This typically includes expected behavior, success conditions, and any constraints.

- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
- [ ] [Criterion 3]

### Test Cases
List the test cases to be implemented before development begins, following the TDD approach.

1. **Test Case 1:** [Brief description of the test case]
2. **Test Case 2:** [Brief description of the test case]
3. **Test Case 3:** [Brief description of the test case]

### Steps to Follow (TDD Process)
1. **Write the Test**  
   - Outline the test logic and expected outcome.
   - Ensure the test fails initially, as no implementation exists yet.
  
2. **Implement the Minimum Code**  
   - Write just enough code to pass the test.
  
3. **Refactor and Optimize**  
   - Refactor the code to improve performance or readability while keeping tests green.

4. **Repeat**  
   - Iterate over additional test cases as needed to fulfill all acceptance criteria.

### Expected Outcome
[Describe the expected outcome of the feature or functionality after all tests pass and refactoring is complete.]

### Additional Notes
[Any extra information or context that might be useful for understanding the task or handling edge cases.]

### Checklist
- [ ] Write initial failing tests
- [ ] Write minimal code to pass tests
- [ ] Refactor code
- [ ] Verify all tests pass and refactoring doesn’t break functionality
